# Virtual Phone Demo

This project is a simple prototype of a virtual phone interface built with a single HTML file (`Phone.html`). It showcases a phone-style layout and basic UI elements for experimentation and learning.

## Getting Started

1. Open `Phone.html` in your browser.
2. Interact with the on-screen elements to explore the demo.

## Project Structure

- `Phone.html` – main page containing all markup, styles, and scripts for the demo.

## Goals

- Practice building custom UI layouts with HTML and CSS.
- Experiment with interactive elements of a phone interface.
